                    <p>Organise by priority, deadline, or time of day.</p>
                    <p>Keep your wording action oriented (e.g. Fix login bug instead of Do coding).</p>
                    <p>Add context if needed (links, notes).</p>

                <p>A good to-do list isn't just functional, it should be easy to read and fun to use. Use headings, labels, and checkboxes to keep everything structured.</p>

                <h2>Stay Synced</h2>
                <p>Your list should move with you. Start it on your laptop, update it on your phone, and share it with your teammates. That way everyone knows what's done and what still needs work.</p>
